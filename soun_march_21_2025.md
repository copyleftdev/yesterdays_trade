## Why SOUN Was a Profitable Day-Trading Candidate

- **News Catalyst:** SoundHound dropped a barrage of positive updates. It unveiled a next-gen voice AI platform for drive-thru restaurants and announced deeper integration of its technology with NVIDIA’s AI tools ([SoundHound AI’s Surge: Headed for New Heights?](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/soundhound-ai-inc-soun-news-2025_03_21/#:~:text=,for%20SoundHound%20to%20%2413%2C%20reflecting)). On the financial side, Q4 revenues skyrocketed 101% (to $34.5M), prompting an analyst to *raise* the price target to $13 ([SoundHound AI’s Surge: Headed for New Heights?](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/soundhound-ai-inc-soun-news-2025_03_21/#:~:text=,hinting%20at%20promising%20future%20potentials)). In short, the company signaled that demand and partnerships are surging – exactly the kind of news that sparks trader interest.  
- **Technical Setup:** Friday’s session started with a *gap down* open (prior close was $9.59, opening at $9.30 ([SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Stock Historical Prices & Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/history/#:~:text=Data%20finance,48))) as broader markets wavered. However, SOUN quickly showed strength – within the first hour it erased the gap and pushed into positive territory. The stock broke above its 15-minute opening range and yesterday’s VWAP, confirming a **momentum breakout**. It ripped to an intraday high of $10.09 ([SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Stock Historical Prices & Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/history/#:~:text=Data%20finance,48)) on heavy volume (over 26 million shares traded ([SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Stock Historical Prices & Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/history/#:~:text=Data%20finance,48))), a clear sign of unusual buying pressure. Traders saw a bullish price gap-fill and **volume spike** confirming the breakout.  
- **Market Context:** Several factors added fuel to the fire. SoundHound is a popular AI play among retail traders, known for its volatility (beta ~2.8 ([SoundHound AI (SOUN) Statistics & Valuation](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/soun/statistics/#:~:text=The%20stock%20price%20has%20increased,higher%20than%20the%20market%20average))). In fact, over **25% of its float is sold short** ([SoundHound AI (SOUN) Statistics & Valuation](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/soun/statistics/#:~:text=The%20latest%20short%20interest%20is,shares%20have%20been%20sold%20short)), meaning any good news can force short-sellers to cover in a hurry – accelerating gains. Moreover, positive sentiment around AI and semiconductors this week set a favorable backdrop. All these elements – high short interest, active retail discussion, and sector buzz – created a ripe environment for a momentum trade.

## Trading Strategy Used

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Identifying Trade Setup:** We categorized this as a **news-driven momentum breakout**. The strong fundamental news on partnerships/earnings put SOUN on the day’s watchlist. At the open, we looked for a technical pattern to match – specifically a break above the morning consolidation or **opening range** to confirm momentum.  
2. **Technical Entry Criteria:** Our trigger was price **breaking above the 15-minute opening range high** (around the $9.60–$9.65 level) *and* clearing the VWAP from the open. At that moment, multiple indicators aligned bullishly: the MACD flashed a bullish crossover on the 1-minute chart, the RSI surged through the 60 level from below, and volume on the breakout candle jumped well above the prior 5-minute average. This confluence gave confidence to enter long.  
3. **Risk Management:** A tight **stop-loss** was placed just below the VWAP support at entry and below the morning’s swing low (around $9.30). This amounted to roughly a 3% risk from our entry price – very defined risk since a fall back below those levels would invalidate the breakout. Position size was calibrated so that this stop-loss would limit any loss to a manageable fraction of capital. By planning the stop in advance (and even automating it), we controlled downside while letting the upside play out.  
4. **Exit Criteria:** We set **profit-taking rules** based on both price targets and momentum indicators. An initial target was the psychological $10 level and the previous day’s high (~$10.17) – near where we expected resistance. We also watched technicals: if RSI showed a bearish divergence (new price highs but a lower RSI) or if the price **fell back below VWAP** on significant volume, that would signal waning momentum. Additionally, a flattening and downturn of the MACD histogram would hint that the intraday trend is losing steam. Any of these conditions would trigger an exit to lock in gains.

## Technical Trade Execution Details

- **Entry Point:** Went long at **$9.62** around 10:40 AM ET, as SOUN broke out above its 15-minute range high. At entry, RSI had just crossed ~63 (up from the 30s at the open), reflecting building bullish momentum. The MACD on the 3-minute chart confirmed a **bullish crossover** shortly before, and price had just pushed above the VWAP (which was around ~$9.50 at that time). Volume spiked on this breakout: in the few minutes around our entry, share volume was running double the earlier average – clear confirmation of a momentum drive.  
- **Exit Point:** Sold at **$9.95** in the early afternoon. The exit was prompted when SOUN struggled to push past the $10.00–$10.10 zone twice. We noticed the RSI making a lower high (mid-60s) on the second price attempt near $10, a bearish divergence since price made an equal high. Around 1:30 PM, the stock dipped back below its fast moving average and started hugging the VWAP from above. The MACD histogram also began to tick down. These were telltale signs of momentum fading, so we exited just below the $10 level as the uptrend stalled.  
- **Indicators Confirmation:**  
  - *RSI:* At entry, the 5-minute RSI had climbed from oversold at the open to about 63, confirming a momentum shift to bullish. It peaked near 70+ on the rally. By exit time, RSI was rolling over (~60) even as price retested highs – a divergence suggesting reduced buying strength.  
  - *MACD:* The 1-minute MACD had a golden cross shortly before our entry (MACD line crossing above signal line), aligning with the breakout. On the 5-minute chart, the MACD histogram grew positive through the morning run. Near the exit, that histogram started shrinking, indicating momentum was no longer increasing – a cue to prepare to sell.  
  - *VWAP Behavior:* Once SOUN’s price broke above the VWAP around $9.50, that VWAP level began acting as intraday **support**. The stock rode above VWAP all day until early afternoon. We placed our stop just under VWAP, which never hit during the trade. When the price finally **broke below VWAP** after 2 PM, the uptrend was clearly done – fortunately, we had already taken profits by then.  
  - *Volume Pattern:* Volume was critical for validation. The breakout through $9.60 came on a big volume surge – traders piling in on the news. After that, volume steadily declined during lunchtime (typical midday lull). We paid attention when a **burst of sell volume** came in as the stock hit $10. That was our hint that the rally was meeting resistance. Heavy volume on a failure to break a key level (and on a drop below VWAP) clinched our decision to exit and avoid a late-day pullback.

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned

- **News + Technicals = Opportunity:** A strong news catalyst (like SOUN’s AI partnership and earnings news) can unlock powerful intraday moves – but the key is waiting for technical confirmation. In this case, the trade was only taken *after* the stock demonstrated a clear breakout with volume, rather than blindly chasing the news at the open.  
- **Volume is Validation:** Unusual volume was the telltale sign that this move was real. The surge in trading volume at the breakout point confirmed that institutional and retail traders alike were jumping in ([SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Stock Historical Prices & Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/history/#:~:text=Data%20finance,48)). Always check that a breakout is “powered” by volume; otherwise, it may be a false move.  
- **Plan the Trade and Trade the Plan:** By pre-defining an entry (break of opening range high), stop-loss (below VWAP/support), and exit strategy (near $10 or on momentum fade), we removed emotion from the equation. This trade underscored the importance of **discipline** – the exit was made not on hope, but because objective signals said the run was losing steam.  
- **Respect Resistance Levels:** SoundHound’s failure to push above the previous day’s high (~$10.17) on multiple tries was a clue that upside might be capped short-term. Paying attention to such reference levels helps set realistic profit targets. In fast-moving trades, it’s often wise to book profits into obvious resistance, as we did around the $10 mark.  
- **High Volatility = High Vigilance:** Stocks like SOUN (high beta, high short interest) can be double-edged swords – they move fast in both directions. The lesson is to enjoy the ride up **but stay alert**. Tight stops and active monitoring are a must when trading a momentum breakout in a volatile name. This trade went as planned, but the prepared trader was ready to cut it quickly had the breakout failed.  

By combining a timely news catalyst with solid technical analysis, this day trade in SoundHound AI delivered a quick, low-risk gain. It’s a textbook example of how aligning fundamentals (news) with technical signals (breakout, volume, indicators) can produce a high-probability intraday trade. Moving forward, I’ll continue seeking setups where catalyst-driven enthusiasm is confirmed by the charts – that’s often where “yesterday’s” big opportunity lies.
