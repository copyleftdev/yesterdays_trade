## Strategy in Pseudocode (Algorithmic Trader Reference)

```pseudo
function TradeYesterday(stock):
    if not HasSignificantNews(stock):
        return "No news catalyst."

    data = FetchIntradayData(stock)
    opening_range = CalculateOpeningRange(data, minutes=15)
    breakout_price = opening_range.high
    indicators = CalculateIndicators(data, ["RSI", "MACD", "VWAP"])

    if PriceBreaksAbove(data, breakout_price) and indicators.MACD.isBullish and indicators.RSI.crossesAbove(60) and VolumeSpike(data):
        entry = breakout_price
        stop_loss = indicators.VWAP * 0.97

        shares = AllocateCapital(available_capital, entry)
        position = EnterTrade(stock, shares, entry, stop_loss)

        while TradingHours():
            data = UpdateIntradayData(stock)
            indicators = UpdateIndicators(data)

            if indicators.RSI.showsBearishDivergence() or PriceDropsBelow(indicators.VWAP):
                exit_price = data.currentPrice
                ExitTrade(position, exit_price)
                break

        return CalculateProfitLoss(entry, exit_price, shares)
